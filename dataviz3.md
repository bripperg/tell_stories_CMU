# Dataviz number 3: Assignment 3 & 4: Critique by Design

### Step one:

Here is the website to the article and pie chart I'm re-designing: [https://www.saferack.com/falls-lead-in-workplace-fatalities/](https://www.saferack.com/falls-lead-in-workplace-fatalities/)

### Step two:

I submitted my responses thru the google form

### Step three:

Here is my wireframe created from Balsamiq

**Anna Kolesnikova, Brent Ripperger Telling Stories with Data - Fall 2020 - Mini 1**

Hi Brent,

See my comments below.

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

I can clearly see a ladder that conveys not good news because of its color and a downward arrow trend. The title confirms my assumption: it is statistics for workplace fatalities.

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
It's telling me that I should carefully watch my step when walking. Or working. :)

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
I find the "Other" category pretty surprising. It makes up to more than 1/3 of all the amount. I would like to see more information on it.
Also, I have no idea what X-axis name means. OSHA looks confusing,

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
I question employers from the construction industry.

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

1. I would remove the more "Path to Zero" and instead simply add 0 on an intersection of the axes.

2. I would make the size of quadrants more proportional. Despite there is a little difference among them, they are still different, and I believe it would be better if their size reflected it.

3. I personally would rather prefer % vs units because when seeing such charts, I automatically begin to calculate approximate shares of each category.

4. I would convert the title into a message something similar to the article's one "Falls Lead in Workplace Fatalities" since each chart should transfer a particular idea. And a subtitle should serve as a brief clarification on a title.

5. Rename X-axis.

Hope this helps!

Hi Brent - sure! I am still working on my sketch, so I may ping you also.

Very nice chart. What did you use to create it?

Can you tell me what you think this is?
The chart is a breakdown of the top four causes of fatalities at construction sites in 2015.

Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
I see that falls represent almost 40% of the fatalities and the three other causes represent the same proportions. There is another very large group called Other.

Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
The arrow called Path to Zero. Not sure what it means since it is not over time and the counts end at a big bucket. Also, I like seeing the whole numbers instead of percents, but the counts don't seem to add to the total (4379) -- very minor, but I had to calculate the percentages.
I do like the use of red color and size of the boxes, but maybe make the lower counts a lighter red.

Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
The audience would be anyone working in the construction industry, friends and family of construction workers and anyone trying to improve safety in the construction industry. The audience would also include OSHA.

Is there anything you would change or do differently?
I think the Other bucket throws off the original and this chart because it is so big. I really like this chart more than the original though! Not sure if you should add cumulative percent on the x-axis, or maybe the percents are in the boxes?


Great job Brent!

**Brent Ripperger, my thoughts:**
I was wondering if the path to zero would be too much, that’s an industry term meaning that companies should use a safety plan that drives you to zero. It’s too much industry jargon, great feedback! “Who this is for” wasn’t correct for either person, so I will need to make that more clear. It’s intended for construction companies, probably safety leaders or managers. The other category is surprising to anyone not in construction, although there are another 18 categories that all share a very small sliver of the remaining. I don’t think I need to clarify here, the target audience won’t be thrown off. Loved the feedback! My sketch did better than I thought.
