# Dataviz number 3: Assignment 3 & 4: Critique by Design

### Step one:

Here is the website to the article and pie chart I'm re-designing: [https://www.saferack.com/falls-lead-in-workplace-fatalities/](https://www.saferack.com/falls-lead-in-workplace-fatalities/)

### Step two:

I submitted my responses thru the google form

### Step three:

Here is my wireframe created from Balsamiq

### Step four:

**Anna Kolesnikova, Brent Ripperger Telling Stories with Data - Fall 2020 - Mini 1**

Hi Brent,

See my comments below.

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

I can clearly see a ladder that conveys not good news because of its color and a downward arrow trend. The title confirms my assumption: it is statistics for workplace fatalities.

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
It's telling me that I should carefully watch my step when walking. Or working. :)

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
I find the "Other" category pretty surprising. It makes up to more than 1/3 of all the amount. I would like to see more information on it.
Also, I have no idea what X-axis name means. OSHA looks confusing,

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
I question employers from the construction industry.

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

1. I would remove the more "Path to Zero" and instead simply add 0 on an intersection of the axes.

2. I would make the size of quadrants more proportional. Despite there is a little difference among them, they are still different, and I believe it would be better if their size reflected it.

3. I personally would rather prefer % vs units because when seeing such charts, I automatically begin to calculate approximate shares of each category.

4. I would convert the title into a message something similar to the article's one "Falls Lead in Workplace Fatalities" since each chart should transfer a particular idea. And a subtitle should serve as a brief clarification on a title.

5. Rename X-axis.

Hope this helps!

Hi Brent - sure! I am still working on my sketch, so I may ping you also.

Very nice chart. What did you use to create it?

Can you tell me what you think this is?
The chart is a breakdown of the top four causes of fatalities at construction sites in 2015.

Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
I see that falls represent almost 40% of the fatalities and the three other causes represent the same proportions. There is another very large group called Other.

Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
The arrow called Path to Zero. Not sure what it means since it is not over time and the counts end at a big bucket. Also, I like seeing the whole numbers instead of percents, but the counts don't seem to add to the total (4379) -- very minor, but I had to calculate the percentages.
I do like the use of red color and size of the boxes, but maybe make the lower counts a lighter red.

Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
The audience would be anyone working in the construction industry, friends and family of construction workers and anyone trying to improve safety in the construction industry. The audience would also include OSHA.

Is there anything you would change or do differently?
I think the Other bucket throws off the original and this chart because it is so big. I really like this chart more than the original though! Not sure if you should add cumulative percent on the x-axis, or maybe the percents are in the boxes?


Great job Brent!

**Brent Ripperger, my thoughts:**
I was wondering if the path to zero would be too much, that’s an industry term meaning that companies should use a safety plan that drives you to zero. It’s too much industry jargon, great feedback! “Who this is for” wasn’t correct for either person, so I will need to make that more clear. It’s intended for construction companies, probably safety leaders or managers. The other category is surprising to anyone not in construction, although there are another 18 categories that all share a very small sliver of the remaining. I don’t think I need to clarify here, the target audience won’t be thrown off. Loved the feedback! My sketch did better than I thought.


### Step five:

Here is the website to the article and pie chart I'm re-designing: [https://www.saferack.com/falls-lead-in-workplace-fatalities/](https://www.saferack.com/falls-lead-in-workplace-fatalities/)

I chose the topic because safety is a big topic in industrial manufacturing. Every company and client must value safety and target zero injuries (injuries and even near misses, let alone fatalities). Why I specifically chose the visual for this exercise, that's because the chart posted on the article didn't properly capture the two major items for SafeRack's intent. First, they want to sell fall protection. Second, they want to inform safety managers how fall protection can have a big impact on overall safety of a company. SafeRack took the approach of using safety metrics from OSHA, where falls are major areas of risk, to sell fall protection. This isn't the best strategy, but it will work. Safety is the selling point of fall protection. For the viz SafeRack used, I wasn't a huge fan of the color or visual pie chart. First, they are wanting to highlight falls yet they are coloring the top four safety causes. Electrocution, caught-in/between, and hit by objects doesn't have anything to do with their business in fall protection. Also, percentages aren't enough for getting people's attention. 4300 deaths is a big deal when companies are targeting zero. A percentage doesn't properly show how far we are away, that means I needed to quantify the percentages. 
  
Prior to the prototype, I had to find the visual (viz) to critique. That was the difficult part, I went through multiple topics until settling on safety. Once I targeted safety, OSHA was the clear company to reference. They are responsible for safety in the industry. The "Fatal Four" is a major topic within safety training, so I looked for articles referencing OSHA and the Fatal Four. I found the article from SafeRack selling fall protection! Then, the critique was extremely helping answering a few questions I hadn't thought of. Mainly, what is the target audience? That helped clear up how the viz was missing its intent. Obviously the viz had clear issues with pie chart, percentages and color. But, finding how it missed the company's intent finalized my choice. Using Balsamiq to build a wireframe example, I was able to solidify my intuition that a waterfall chart was the best choice. I jumped in with sketching an example. I've found waterfall vizs extremely beneficial in the past, they tell a story through the interpretation of the viz. I immediately jumped to that viz choice over the pie chart. After the skeleton, I decided on my color palette. Red made sense, it is a serious topic and base knowledge is red=bad. I also added the path to zero arrow, as an enhancement to make the reader focus on actions to take. 

Moving to a prototype, I submitted my wireframe to my classmates. They responded with great feedback. A few of my concerns around the path to zero line were realized, so I brainstormed ways to get my intent across better. A big topic, I had to get the data. I looked on OSHA's website for the raw data, to understand the metrics under "Other". Although the raw data was on their website, the data required looking through every inspection report to find the cause classification. Because of that, I pivoted my approach and just typed in the 5 categories into Excel. Then, I built the viz in Power BI by reading the Excel file. I grabbed the waterfall chart, per initial design. I also kept the color palette because design/classmates agreed. At this point, I took a moment to think about how I wanted to get viewers to think about developing a safety plan. Companies buy fall protection because they plan safety, not because of the lagging statistic of fatalities. I decided to use the title, that being the first thing they read: "start your safety plan to zero." The goal being to get them prepped for the message. Assuming they will/are using a safety plan, I wanted to make it clear the MAJOR area for improvement is falls, so therefore I highlighted falls. From my feedback, I was also told percentage is a big deal, so I included a text callout to give that detail to the reader. The first chart had good vocab and design, so I had to make sure and maintain that functionality. Using good alignment and text call-out, I think I was able to add some additional professionalism. When I was reviewing at this point, and according to feedback about not knowing the true audience, I wanted to use the subtitle to give more context to who should be looking at this data, construction. And with the portion on helping the community, I'm trying to get some sort of urgency and call to action. We want them to immediately take steps to mitigating falls. Some final axis titles and coloring finished my visual!
