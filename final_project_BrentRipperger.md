# Final Project: PennDOT Bridge Asset Management, Helping Maintain Sustainability
###### The story of how maintenance and innovation can lead to a better future

# Part I: The Idea


#### Outline

Although we may not notice it, bridge health is a major topic that needs to be addressed. Bridge asset preservation in the United States is not as passive as we believe, preventing catastrophy takes a great deal of effort. There has been a spike in bridge failures over the last 20 years and countries like Germany and the United States are investing in preservation. New technologies have been developed to evaluate real-time health of structures and strategies to maintain them efficiently. I plan to take my readers through a story that is going to start from the realities of our current situation and finish at a solution for the **very** near future. 


#### Major Elements
1. History of bridges, quickly thru the industrial revolution to the 2000s (innovations between the decades)

2. The trend of bridge failures from 1980 - 2020, major spike in bridge failures

3. The funding initiatives put in place by PennDOT recently to help tackle the trends

4. The current inspeciton reports for the health of PennDOT bridges, where PA is at and how they are working towards preserving assets

5. How we can leverage Finite Element Analysis (FEE) technology with cogintive sensors to predict how long bridges can operate before risking lives

6. How the hero can be the reader, to fund these strategies to properly stay in control of bridge asset management

##### Major Recent Technology for Use In Bridges

Listening to bridges is when we attach sensors to the bridge. The sensors passively wait for cracks/impacts to occur and inform crews (sometimes within 10cm) where the issue has propigated. 

Also, Akselos is another technolgoy developed by MIT. It uses an old strategy for calculating the current health of a structure. The major selling point though is that in the past, the effort usually takes 2 weeks to hand calculate the proper formulas to represent the structure. Now, through servers, we can have computers run the complex mathmatical expressions to provide real-time health. 

The selling point is to link the two technologies to work off each other. Past data is input into the Akselos model (ie cracks, corrosion, bends, etc), present data is fed from the sensors attached, and future data is predicted through the algorithyms. It's a holistic solution that allows one person to maintain a whole network of bridges. Efficiently sending crews to the proper maintenance points, understanding which bridges will need to be replaced within the next 5 years, and extending the life of bridges that typically would have to be shutdown. This will also save the need for the yearly inspections that're required by states.

#### The Data

PennDOT's publically available data is my major source. 

I've researched and pulled data on the current status of all the bridges in Pennsylvania. This gives me a snapshot of the current health of bridges with good, fair, and poor ratings. I pulled the data late last year for a work project, but I want to use this opportunity to share the full story we are facing. 

[Download at Website: Conditions of State and Local Bridges](https://www.penndot.gov/ProjectAndPrograms/Bridges/Pages/default.aspx)

Thru my research, I uncovered a presentation from PennDOT on their implementation program for capital and maintenance of bridges. This was publically available on PennDOT's website. The presentation discusses how they have been developing their asset management and the tools metrics they are starting to track.

Second, I used Wikipedia to understand the global bridge failures. There is a documented table of what happened, how many were injured, and what is the overall trend. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_bridge_failures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_bridge_failures)

Third, I found data on the history of bridges. [https://truetechbridge.com/about-us/history/](https://truetechbridge.com/about-us/history/)

Finally, I plan to use some company documentation on Akselos and Listening to Bridges that can allow me to create some unique visuals on the impact and benefit of these faster tools that have been developed and reapplying them to this situation.

#### Method and medium

I plan to use Shorthand as my medium for presenting the data. It will work well for "progressing" through the story as readers scroll through the page. 

Readers will start by scrolling through the history of bridges. It will ground them on how far we (as a society) have come and what creations we've been able to achieve. 

Then, the readers will be presented with how we've seen an increase in bridge failures. As the readers are scrolling through the page, they will get a few snips and highlights. I hope to add some intelligient "navigation bars" to show an overall timeline and where they are. 

After the history, the page will start to get more positive. I will focus on how PennDOT has started to invest in correcting the issue at hand. Although, the correction have been to close bridges, which isn't sustainable as they are closing more than is required. I will share data with how in roughly 2011 we had 62 bridges closed, now there are 1900 bridges.

The reader will now be ready to receive my message, I will re-adjust the reader to seeing where the **true value** is and how we can leverage technologies from other industries into the bridge asset preservation. I will present how a few key tools have recently come to the market that can efficienty, accurately, and contiously track health of bridges and alert on issues as they arise. The tools lower maintenance effort and increase safety with quality. It will also allow us to intelligently evaluate bridges to understand the proper amount of bridge closings that're required. 

I will create visuals to represent Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and use Tableau to create a few visualizations around the data I have for "poor quality" bridges in Pittsburgh. 

My audience will be public officials/penndot employees in asset management. The goal will be that they can be the hero, they can bring an amazing new strategy to their business to make life safer for our citizens. 


# Part II: User Research and Storyboard

1. [Storyboard](/Storyboard.pptx)
2. [Protocol with Answers](/Protocol_with_Answers.docx)

Target Audience, PennDOT employee responsible for the budget to maintain the health and safety of bridges in Pennsylvania.

1. Participant 1: Male, 60s, Professional in Information Systems, background in programming and finance
2. Participant 2: Female, 60s, Professional Accountant CPA, background in legal
Participant 
3. Female, upper 20s, clinical psycology PhD student at UPitt, background in medical research
4. Changes, refer to document. I plan to make major changes in the stating of facts. I am currently relying too much on implications, and I need to help the reader draw conclusions from the data vizs presented. Also, I need be more clear with the links between visuals and the entire "story telling" aspect

# Part III: Final Data Story

My intended audience is PennDOT employees responsible for bridge asset management and inspections. I tailored this project to them by talking about their achievements, but also making goals clear for zero bridge failures. I also brought up their research and history to bring to light the knowledge that I have done the research on their business. Also, I included some jargon that they will know, but also doesn't lose the random audience members that might see my page (like "Poor" condition means something different to public vs PennDOT. I included many quotes from my research that support my point. A lot of the presentations from PennDOT include key things that I'd like to provide, they admit it is beneficialy. This will align our goals, so they feel like we can speak the same language and help each other. 

I also removed stuff that seemed to make the presentation drag on, like intro-ing into the website with history of bridges. I realized that it took away from the point I'm trying to get my readers to, and also it confused them with data that isn't relavent to the solution I present later. I also removed the part about funding intiatives. Prelimnary research showed they have increased their funding, but further investigation found that bridge specific spending is actually decreasing! At least the projects they are funding is on the decline. Additionally, I included links that allow them to research the topic VERY indepth. I gave them direct links to partners of Bilfinger, while also Bilfinger's site for NDT testing and cognitive sensors. All of this will help them be able to be well educated, before the call to action if they prefer. 

Color use here took a lot of consideration. I ended up designing a neutral background for most of the text, but used a bright blue feature for any time I bring up questions the reader should be asking. This makes the questions impactful and not missed by the reader. I feel that really helped make the story flow, efficiently with the reader. It was one of my more favorite touches. Also, the Minnesota failure was added close to the end. I really needed a quick way to show the thing we are risking by not doing something about it. The data speaks well, but to me the crashed bridge and deathes really drive an emotional reaction that I think will help my cause. 

My most eye-opening area is "The Steps". This is another design techniquie in persuaion, I am very clearly tieing a bow on the entire solution I presented. To me, this simply shows the solution without getting into all the jargon that would be required otherwise. Also, I like my closing call to action. The three leading questions with a clear, enroll this bridge.
