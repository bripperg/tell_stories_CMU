# Final Project: PennDOT Bridge Asset Management, Helping Maintain Sustainability
###### The story of how mainenance and innovation can lead to a better future


#### Outline

Maintenance on bridges in the United States is not as passive as people believe, preventing catastrophy takes a great deal of effort. Bridge integrity is a major topic in developed countries, places like Germany and the United States are investing in preventing a recent rise in bridge failures. New technologies have been developed to evaluate, real-time, the health of brigdes and ways to maintain them efficiently. This story is going to take my readers from the realities of the current situation to the solution for the very near future. 


###### Major Elements
1. History of bridge, quickly thru the industrial revolution to the 2000s, through the innovations between decades

2. The trend of bridge failures from 1980 - 2020, major spike in bridge failures

3. The funding initiatives put in place by PennDOT recently to help tackle the trends

4. The current inspeciton reports for the health of PennDOT bridges, where PA is at and how they are working towards preserving assets

5. How we can leverage Finite Element Analysis (FEE) technology with cogintive sensors to predict how long bridges can operate before risking lives

6. How the hero can be the reader, to fund these strategies to properly stay in control of bridge asset management

#### The Data

PennDOT's publically available data is my first reference

I did research to pull data on the current status of all the bridges in Pennsylvania. This gives me a snapshot of the current health of bridges. I actually pulled this data late last year for a work project, repurposing the raw data for actually informing people on the full picture. 

I also have a presentation from PennDOT on the implementation program for capital/maintenance for the future. This was publically available on PennDOT's website as well. It discusses how they have been developing their maintenance and preserving bridges. 

Second, I used Wikipedia to understand the global bridge failures. There is a documented table of what happened, how many were injured, and what is the overall trend. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_bridge_failures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_bridge_failures)

Third, I found data on the history of bridges. [https://truetechbridge.com/about-us/history/](https://truetechbridge.com/about-us/history/)

Finally, I plan to use some company documentation on Akselos and Listening to Bridges that can allow me to create some unique visuals on the impact and benefit of these faster tools that have been developed and reapplying them to this situation. [https://akselos.com/](https://akselos.com/) [Listening to Bridges](https://www.bilfinger.com/en/industries/metallurgy/247-technical-inspections-for-bridges/#:~:text=Now%20that%20this%20technology%20has%20been%20refined%2C%20Bilfinger,is%20helping%20to%20make%20Germany%27s%20roads%20even%20safer.)


#### Method and medium

I plan to use Shorthand as my medium for presenting the data. It will work well for "progressing" through the story as readers scroll through the page. 

Readers will start by scrolling through the history of bridges. It will ground them on how far we have come and what cool things we've been able to do. Then, they will get presented with how there have been an increase in bridge issues. As they are scrolling through, they will get a few snips and highlights. I hope to add some intelligient "navigation bars" to show an overall timeline and where they are. After than, it will start to get more positive because PennDOT has started to invest in the correction. Although the correction has been to close many bridges, which isn't sustainable. So I will re-adjust the reader to seeing where the true value is and how we can leverage technologies from other industries into the bridge asset preservation. I will present how a few key tools have recently come to the market that can efficienty, accurately, and contiously track health of bridges and alert on issues. They lower maintenance effort and increase safety with quality. I will create some generic visual to represent some Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and use Tableau to create a few visualizations around the data I have for "poor quality" bridges in Pittsburgh. My audience will be public officials/penndot employees in asset management. The goal will be that they can be the hero, they can bring an amazing new strategy to their business to make life safer for our citizens.
