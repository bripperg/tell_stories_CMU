# What I hope to learn from telling stories with data

1. Additional tools at my disposal when creating visualizations. To date, my only tools are PowerPoint, Prezi, Power BI, and Excel. 

2. How to crituqe constructively. I have colleagues that are creating many reports for our client, and I want to assist them in designing impactful reports. My group tends to technically design/KPI overload their reports. I want to learn how to help minimize. 

3. Science and compelling justifications behind why simple reports are valueable. I have a few managers that always want to add more and more and more KPIs/visualtions to my reports, trying to fit everyone on one page. I want to learn how to verbally explain how those actually ruin the effect of the visualizes. I want to help remove the need for "The Martha Stewart."
