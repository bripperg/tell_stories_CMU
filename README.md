#### Work

I received my BS in Mechanical Engineering. I joined Bilfinger Industrial Services' full-time staff as a cost engineer. I assist our industrial clients in business planning. My major industries are consumer products, chemicals, and oil & gas. I help our clients understand the cost implications of their business plans through conceptual and feasibility estimating engineering and construction effort. Clients rely on our output to make decisions on scope they can afford. Once projects are funded, I then typically assist project managers to deliver the projects (cost planning, cost tracking, and forecasting).

Over the last year, I have been consistently developing data solutions for my company. Mostly helping to optimize the way our business currently operates, but also adding enhancements that deliver our company mission statement as an innovative partner for our clients. When I found the BIDA program at CMU, I knew it was the perfect way to help educate myself for how my role in the company is transitioning.


#### Interests

I don't want to drag this out, so I will highlight some of the major interests of mine

My major "work-related" interests are urban development and personal finance. Both of these topics I find extremely interested! I am constantly trying to think of a business/opportunity around urban development and BIDA, if you think of any let me know. I typically navigate towards mixed-use developments, redevelopment, and community spaces. Also, I love personal finance. I use Mint and it takes up more than I'd like to admit for my free time. If you ever have any questions regarding personal finance, I would love to be a resource. 

Anything termed as "active leisure", I am in! Hike, bike, run, climb, sports, canoe, etc. If you want to do any of these, hit me up!

I also enjoy board games, movies, and fiction books. 


# What I hope to learn from telling stories with data

1. Additional tools at my disposal when creating visualizations. To date, my only tools are PowerPoint, Prezi, Power BI, and Excel. 

2. How to crituqe constructively. I have colleagues that are creating many reports for our client, and I want to assist them in designing impactful reports. My group tends to technically design/KPI overload their reports. I want to learn how to help minimize. 

3. Science and compelling justifications behind why simple reports are valueable. I have a few managers that always want to add more and more and more KPIs/visualtions to my reports, trying to fit everyone on one page. I want to learn how to verbally explain how those actually ruin the effect of the visualizes. I want to help remove the need for "The Martha Stewart."
