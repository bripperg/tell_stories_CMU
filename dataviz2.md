### Government Debt-to-GDP Ratio

Government Debt-to-GDP is a great way to visualize relative debt between countries. 

An upward trajectory means countries' debts are rising faster than their respective GDP. Notice how Japan has more than doubled since 1995. The United States of America, Great Britain, and France all started taking on debt around 2007 (US stock market crashed at that time), potentially so that each country could stabilze their economy. Germany and Canada have been on downward trends since 2012 and 1996, respectively.
